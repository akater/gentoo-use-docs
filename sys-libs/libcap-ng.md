# sys-libs/libcap-ng

### python
For each enabled Python target execute the configure script. For version 2, pass the `--with-python` and the `--without-python3` options. For version 3, pass the `--with-python` and the `--with-python3` options and append the `-fno-strict-aliasing` option to the `CFLAGS` variable for a duration of the build. Execute the `make` command from the `bindings/python` directory of the source tree for each enabled Python target to build the `capng` module - Python bindings for the `libcap-ng` library.

This flag should only be enabled if there is a need to run Python scripts that use the `capng` module.

### static-libs
Pass the `--enable-shared` and the `--enable-static` (or the `--disable-static` if the flag is disabled) options to the configure script. Build and install a statically linked version of the `libcap-ng` library.

This flag should only be enabled if there is an explicit need for the static library.
