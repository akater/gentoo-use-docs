# sys-libs/tevent

### python
Prepare Python environment for a WAF configure script. Build and install a `pytevent` Python module to acess an event system based on the talloc memory management library. When this flag is disabled, pass a `--disable-python` option to the WAF configure script.

This flag should only be enabled if there is a need to run scripts that depend on this module.
