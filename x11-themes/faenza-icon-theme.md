# x11-themes/faenza-icon-theme

### minimal
Avoid pulling in the [x11-themes/adwaita-icon-theme](../x11-themes/adwaita-icon-theme.md) package as a dependency that's normally used as a base icon pack for icons that might be missing in the Faenza theme to save some space.

It is recommended to disable this flag to have proper icon fallback.
