### kerberos
Pull in the [dev-perl/GSSAPI](../dev-perl/GSSAPI.md) package as a dependency. Provide support for client part of the GSSAPI SASL algorithm, as described in RFC 2222 section 7.2.1.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to handle GSSAPI SASL authentication in Perl, e.g. for LDAP.
