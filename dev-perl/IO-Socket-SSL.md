### examples
Install additional example source code that shows how to use `IO::Socket::SSL` module to solve a number of different use cases, including example HTTPS server using nonblocking sockets and simple HTTP/HTTPS proxy into the `/usr/share/doc/IO-Socket-SSL-<VERSION>/examples` directory.

### idn
Pull in one of the packages that can provide an IDN (internationalized domain name) support to be able to establish a connection with hosts that have their domain names in non-Latin, language-specific script or alphabet.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to handle domain names with non-Latin characters.
