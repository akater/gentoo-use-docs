# x11-misc/lightdm-gtk-greeter

### ayatana
Pass the `--enable-libindicator` option to the configure script. Enable support for the Ayatana Indicators via the framework developed by the Canonical for the Ubuntu Unity desktop environment to display supported application indicators in the panel indicator area of the LightDM.

This flag should be disabled as Ubuntu abandoned Unity and switched to the GNOME desktop environment.

### branding
Download and install Gentoo-branded greeter background and patch a config file to use it.

It is safe to disable the flag.
