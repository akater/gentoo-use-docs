### introspection
Generate and install the `GCalc-1.gir` GIR metadata file to provide dynamic bindings for the `libgcalc` library to languages other than C using the GObject Introspection framework. Pass the `-Ddisable-introspection=true` option to the meson build command when this flag is disabled and avoid installation of this GIR metadata file.

It is safe to disable the flag.
