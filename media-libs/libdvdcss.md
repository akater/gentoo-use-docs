# media-libs/libdvdcss

### doc
Pass the `--enable-doc` option to the configure script. Use the Doxygen tool to generate library API documentation in the HTML format and install it into the `/usr/share/doc/libdvdcss-<VERSION>` directory.

It is safe to disable the flag.

### static-libs
Pass the `--enable-static` option to the configure script. Build and install a statically linked version of the `libdvdcss` library.

This flag should only be enabled if there is an explicit need for the static library.
