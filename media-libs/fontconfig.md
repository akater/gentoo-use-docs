# media-libs/fontconfig

### doc
Pass the `--enable-docbook` option to the configure script. Generate documentation from a source code instead of installing a prebuilt one.

It is safe to disable the flag.

### static-libs
Pass the `--enable-static` option to the configure script. Build and install a statically linked version of the `libfontconfig` library.

This flag should only be enabled if there is a need for the static library.
