### doc
Install additional documentation in an HTML format into the `/usr/share/doc/mako-<VERSION>/html` directory.

It is safe to disable this flag.

### test
Run the `pytest` command when the main build is completed to execute the test suite provided with the source code and check for regressions. This will extend the build time.

This flag should normally be disabled as tests are primarily useful for the Gentoo team, testers or developers.
