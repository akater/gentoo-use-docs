### doc
Install additional documentation in an HTML format into the `/usr/share/doc/mako-<VERSION>/html` directory.

It is safe to disable this flag.

### test
Run the `py.test` command when the main build is completed to execute the test suite provided with the source code and check for regressions. This will extend a build time.

This flag should normally be disabled as tests are primarily useful for the Gentoo team, testers or developers.
