### doc
Install additional documentation in an HTML format into the `/usr/share/doc/mako-<VERSION>/html` directory.

It is safe to disable this flag.

Run the Python nose testing tool - `nosetests` to execute a test suite provided with the source code. This will extend a build time.

This flag should normally be disabled as tests are primarily useful for the Gentoo team, testers or developers.
