# dev-libs/libbytesize

### doc
Generate API documentation using the Gtk-Doc tool and install it into the `/usr/share/doc/libbytesize-<VERSION>` directory.

It is safe to disable the flag.

### test
Execute the `make check` command after the main build is completed. Run a test suite provided with the source code. This will extend a build time.

This flag should normally be disabled as it is mainly used by the Gentoo team, testers or developers.
