# dev-libs/yajl

### static-libs
When enabled, the static version of the `libyajl_s` library will be preserved, otherwise it will be deleted from the sandbox build directory before installing the package into the system.

This flag must be enabled if there is a need for the static library and should be disabled otherwise.
