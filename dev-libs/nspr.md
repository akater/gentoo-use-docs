# dev-libs/nspr

### debug
Pass the `--enable-debug` and the `--disable-optimize` options to the configure script if enabled. Build a debug verion of the libraries. Print a great deal of additional information at the runtime. Enable internal tracing.

This flag should normally be disabled. It is useful for the development against NSPR library.
