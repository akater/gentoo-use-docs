### test
Execute the `make check` command after a build is completed. Run a test suite provided with the source code. This will extend a build time. When disabled, patch `Makefile` files to exclude the `tests` directory from being built.

This flag should normally be disabled because it is primarily used by the Gentoo team, testers and developers.
