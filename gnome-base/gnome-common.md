### autoconf-archive
Pull in [sys-devel/autoconf-archive](../sys-devel/autoconf-archive.md) as a denpendency. Use `m4` macro files provided by the Autoconf Archive instead of installing them from the `gnome-common` tarball.

It is recommended to enable this flag, because macro files provided by the Gnome Common are obsolete.
