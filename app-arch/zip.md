### bzip2
Append the `-DBZIP2_SUPPORT` (`-DNOBZIP2_SUPPORT` when disabled) option to the `CPPFLAGS` variable for the duration of a build. Patch a `flags` file generated by the configure script to append a `-lbz2` option to the `LFLAGS2` variable. Provide an ability to compress an archive using a Bzip2 algorithm via the `-Z bzip2` runtime option.

It is safe to disable the flag.

### crypt
Append the `-DCRYPT` (`-DNOCRYPT` if disabled) option to the `CPPFLAGS` variable for the duration of a build. Install a `zipcloak` binary and man page for it. Provide an ability to create encrypted and password protected archives using the `-e` runtime option.

This flag can be safely disabled.

### natspec
Apply a patch to use a `natspec` library for encoding and decoding filenames in ZIP archives. This is necessary to create Windows compatible ZIP archives by converting file names from a system locale into a windows compatible character set.

It is safe to disable the flag.

### unicode
Append the `-DUNICODE_SUPPORT` (`-DNOUNICODE_SUPPORT` when disabled) option to the `CPPFLAGS` variable for the duration of a build. Enable storing and using UTF-8 paths. These paths are stored in a backward-compatible way so that archives with UTF-8 paths still work on zips and unzips that don't support Unicode.

It is recommended to enable this flag.
