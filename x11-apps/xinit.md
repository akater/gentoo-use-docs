# x11-apps/xinit

### minimal
Does nothing if enabled. When disabled, pull in additional packages: [x11-apps/xclock](../x11-apps/xclock.md), [x11-apps/xsm](../x11-apps/xsm.md) and [x11-wm/twm](../x11-wm/twm.md) as dependencies to provide a minimalistic window manager and some utilities.

This flag should normally be enabled, unless there is a need to run a minimalistic GUI without a proper desktop environment.
