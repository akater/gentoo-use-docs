### twm
Pull in the [x11-apps/xclock](../x11-apps/xclock.md), [x11-apps/xsm](../x11-apps/xsm.md), [x11-terms/xterm](../x11-terms/xterm.md) and [x11-wm/twm](../x11-wm/twm.md) packages as dependencies to provide twm (Tab Window Manager) desktop environment.

It is safe to disable the flag if there is no plan to use `twm` on the system.
