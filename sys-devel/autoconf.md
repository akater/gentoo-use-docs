### emacs
Pull a [app-emacs/autoconf-mode](../app-emacs/autoconf-mode.md) package as a dependency. This package contains an Emacs major mode for editing autoconf `ac` and `m4` files and provides basic syntax support.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to use Emacs editor to modify autoconf files.
