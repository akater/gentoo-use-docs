### emacs
Pass the `--with-lispdir` option pointing to the Emacs site-lisp directory. Compile and install an Emacs major mode for `.desktop` files editing. Provide basic support with a syntax highlighting and validation.

This flag should be enabled if there is a need to edit `.desktop` files using an Emacs editor.
